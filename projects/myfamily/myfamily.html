                        Mirabel is the youngest daughter in her family. When she turned five, she did not receive any gift which was the reason why her Abuela was somehow distant to her. But it turns out, she is the only member of the family who can restore the magic of Casita, their house, when all the magic disappeared.

                        Luisa is the middle child in their family. Her gift is her strength which she uses to help other people. She was the first one to notice that her gift or power is fading which then prompted Mirabel to find out what's wrong and try to solve it.

                        Isabela is the eldest daughter in the family. She is known as the perfect daugter. She can grow plants and flowers at her will. It was during her engagement with their neighbor, Mariano Guzman, when the family discovered the prophecy concerning the destruction of Casita.
