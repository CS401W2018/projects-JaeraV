                Painting is one form of visual art in which an artist combines skills in drawing, color combinations, lines, and many more. It is a way someone expresses his or her emotions, feelings and creativity. Painting has been one of the things that helped me cultivate my artistic skills.

                To be more specific, watercolor is one of the medium I love to use when painting. I like watercolor because of its light strokes. It is also easy to use and control, especially for beginners in painting, like me.
