        <p>Running Man is a variety show in South Korea and is broadcasted under Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS). 
            It first aired last 2010 and they are still producing or releasing new episodes until this day. 
            The show is about accomplishing tasks or challenges through games. The current members of 
            the show are, Yoo Jae Seok, Ji Seok Jin, Kim Jong Kook, Ha Dong Hoon (HAHA), 
            Song Ji hyo, and Yang Se Chan.

        <p>I first learned about this show because some of the Korean actors, actresses and even K-pop idols I 
            follow visit the show as guests to make promotions for their drama, movie or comeback music. 
            Nevertheless, I eventually liked this Korean variety show because it is funny. 
            I love their humor and I really like the games they play in the show. Some 
            of these games involve luck and some involves their skills and abilities. 
            It's just fun how they solve the missions they were given.
