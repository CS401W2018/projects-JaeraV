    <h1>Hi! I am <em>Jaera Villar</em></h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in the Philippines. Growing up, I can say that I had an amazing 
        childhood experience. I spent a lot of my time playing outdoor games with 
        my friends. We played <em>&apos;patintero&apos;, &apos;tumbang 
        preso&apos;, &apos;tagu-taguan&apos;,</em> and 
        many more. I was pretty active back then.
    </p>
    <p>When my teen-age years came, I started to spend more time indoors. I am glad that there 
        were resources available online in which we can enhance the skills we already have 
        and discover or develop new ones. Through <mark>watching YouTube videos</mark>, 
        I learned how to <strong>write simple calligraphy, paint using watercolor and 
        acrylic, and even learned how to play few musical instruments.</strong>
