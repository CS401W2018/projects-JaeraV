            <hr class="line">
            <p class="da_definition">
                There are lots of drawing styles that artists use. Every style is unique and tells so much of an artist's preference. Out of all the styles, I like the scribble art, cartoon drawing, and photorealism the most. I like scribble art because of its uniqueness. Through simple lines and scribbles, you can create a masterpiece. For cartoon drawing, it is because it is easier to draw or to do compared to other styles. And lastly, photorealism because it is close to reality. Though it is hard as it requires a lot of time, still the outcome is satisfying.

                    <td>
                        This style relies on soft, irregular lines, small rough circles, and other uneven scribbles. Adjusting the thickness and intensity of the strokes can create variations in shading, depth, texture, and gradients. Dense scribbles produce darker tones, while more spaced-out ones result in lighter areas. Others call this as spidery style.

                        A style of drawing that is close to reality. This usually requires more time, patience and dedication since the drawing is very detailed.

            <h2 class="h_title">My Top 3 Medium in Painting</h2>
            <hr class="line">
            <p class="da_definition">
                From all the available medium used in painting, my top 3 would be acrylic, watercolor and oil. Acrylic is good to use especially when painting highly pigmented paintings. I love how vivid the colors are. Second would be watercolor. As opposed to acrylic, watercolor is good for paintings that are relaxing. More of like "dreamy" kinds of painting. And third would be oil painting, because like acrylic, it gives vivid colors. Using oil also extends the drying time of the paints, making room for changes. They are also good to use because oil paintings last for a long time.

                        Acrylic paint is a flexible and affordable option for artists to express their creativity. It is great for detailed work, layering, and creating textured effects.

                        Watercolor paints are affordable and last a long time since they are diluted with water, but they can be tricky to master. Once applied, fixing mistakes is challenging.
