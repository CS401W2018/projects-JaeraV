            <h2>My Top 3 Drawing Styles</h2>
            <p>
                There are lots of drawing styles that artists use. Every style is unique and tells so much of an artist's preference. Out of all the styles, I like the line drawing, cartoon drawing, and photorealism the most. I like line drawing because of its simplicity. It is simple and aesthetic. For cartoon drawing, it is because it is easier to draw or to do compared to other styles. And lastly, photorealism because it is close to reality. Though it is hard as it requires a lot of time, still the outcome is satisfying.

                        It focuses on making images using simple curved lines and outlines, without adding complex shading. This approach allows for quick and straightforward drawings that do not need advanced artistic skills.

            <h2>My Top 3 Medium in Painting</h2>
            <p>
                From all the available medium used in painting, my top 3 would be acrylic, watercolor and oil. Acrylic is good to use especially when painting highly pigmented paintings. I love how vivid the colors are. Second would be watercolor. As opposed to acrylic, watercolor is good for paintings that are relaxing. More of like "dreamy" kinds of painting. And third would be oil painting, because like acrylic, it gives vivid colors. Using oil also extends the drying time of the paints, making room for changes. They are also good to use because oil paintings last for a long time.

                        Acrylic paint is a flexible and affordable option for artists to express their creativity. It is great for detailed work, layering, and creating textured effects.

                        Watercolor paints are affordable and last a long time since they are diluted with water, but they can be tricky to master. Once applied, fixing mistakes is challenging.
