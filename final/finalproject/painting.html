                    My journey in painting was inspired by a friend of mine. She loves to explore art but not necessarily a big fan of it. Since watercolor was handy, she brought some to school and during our free time, she would paint random things. The watercolor painting of Fin and Jake from “Adventure Time” was a sample of her work. She then urged me to try watercolor as well since she knew that I am a big fan of arts.

                    From then, I started to learn how to use watercolor. I watched countless tutorials from YouTube and Instagram. And searched for references I can use from Pinterest and instagram. It was not that great from the very beginning, but little by little, I saw improvements. As I did some paintings, I then found out how to better apply different shading, how to mix colors and many more.

                    I did watercolor for a time and because of the many resources available today, I discovered acrylic. I liked acrylic because it is highly pigmented and I liked how vivid the colors are. Like what I did when I learned how to do watercolor painting, I applied the same thing on acrylic painting. I followed tutorials on YouTube, as they are excellent at explaining the step-by-step process of painting, from the very beginning to the final touches.
