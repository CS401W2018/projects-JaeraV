                I started drawing with the basics. I used cartoon images of animals and characters as my reference. Cartoons have simple lines and shapes, which makes drawing easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Few examples of these drawings are the simple drawing of a giraffe and a drawing of the cartoon characters, Elsa and Anna.

                I then moved on to the different parts of the face of a person. I did it in a more detailed way. I used the technique that they call as grid.
            </p>
            <p>
                The grid technique in drawing is a method used to help create accurate proportions and details in drawings. It involves dividing a reference image into equal squares by drawing a grid over it. Then in paper or canvas, you need to draw a matching grid and copies the content of each square, one at a time. This technique helps break the drawing into smaller, manageable sections, making it easier to focus on details and maintain the correct proportions.
