                <h3>Drawing</h3>
                <p>
                    Drawing has been one of the first things I started to love in the world of Art. It is when you visualize what you imagine or see and put them on a paper using lines and shapes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another term for drawing is sketching. According to a definition made by Eden Gallery, it is a foundational form of art since artists doing sculpture, painting, and even digital art, develop drawing skills as a core aspect of their craft. However, drawing is more than just a stepping stone to other visual arts. It is a respected artform in itself.

                <h3>Painting</h3>
                <p>
                    Painting is a type of art where colors are applied to a surface, like canvas or paper, to create pictures or designs. It can show ideas, feelings, or stories and can be realistic or abstract.

                <h3>Digital Art</h3>
                <p>
                    Digital art is a type of art made using computers, tablets, or other digital tools. Artists use software to draw, paint, or create images, animations, and designs. It can look like traditional art or have unique effects only possible with technology.
