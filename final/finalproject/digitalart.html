                Digital art involves artistic creations or practices that incorporate digital technology in their creation or presentation. Since the 1960s, this form of art has been known by various terms, such as computer art, electronic art, multimedia art, and new media art. (Information from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art">Wikipedia.com</a>)

                With our evolving technologies at this time, art becomes accessible to everyone. We can create it using our phones, tablets and computers. With its availability and accessibility, this platform provides a way to unleash our creativity in more ways than one. It eliminates the necessity of having all the physical art materials. Instead, we can have all the materials we need in one application.

                I started doing digital art because of the benefits that this form of art offers. Some of these benefits include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accessibility - it offers features that are beneficial to all. Some includes colorblind-friendly designs.</li>
                <li>Aesthetics - there are tools available for any creativity or design you might want. It can be 2D or even 3D.</li>
                <li>Budget - this form of art can be created using phones, tablets and computers. Meaning, you don't need to buy all the physical art materials that are often expensive.</li>
                <li>Efficiency - if you make mistakes in your artwork, you can easily repair it using undo command, unlike in physical artwork where mistakes are sometimes irreparable.</li>
                <li>Enhancements - technology enables artists to refine traditional works. For instance, a painter can upload their artwork to digital editing software to adjust a stroke, deepen a color, or add entirely new hues.</li>
                <li>Space and waste - digital art only requires minimal space as using a tablet will be enough, compared to traditional art where you need studios and all.</li>
                <li>Speed - switching between colors or even tools are done within few clicks.</li>
            </ul>
