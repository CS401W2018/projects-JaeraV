        <h2>Proposal for the Final Project - Jaera Villar</h2>

        <h4>The title and topic of your site.</h4>
        <p>My Portfolio. It would be all about the projects I have completed, including the classes I've taken and the skills I developed.</p>

        <h4>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h4>
        <p>I chose this topic because I wanted to atleast set up my portfolio. Also, I can use it in the future if ever I search for internships or even work. And I will be able to see the things that I need to work on and maybe look or monitor my progress as well.</p>

        <h4>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h4>
        <p>Home Page - Background Information about me.</p>
        <p>Page 1 - Skills</p>
        <p>Page 2 - Resume</p>
        <p>Page 3 - Projects Compeleted </p>
        <p>Page 4 - Classes taken (table)</p>
        <p>Page 5 - Contact for Inquiries (forms)</p>

        <h4>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h4>
        <p>Fields of information to collect, name of company or individual, contact number, name of project and little description, duration of the project.</p>
        <p>The data that will go on my table would be the list of the classes I have taken and the semesters I took them.</p>

        <h4>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h4>
        <p>For the content, I will look for the projects I've completed before. I can screenshot some of them so that I can put sample pictures of what I did before. For the information, I will use W3Schools for some definitions and also Wikipedia.</p>

        <h4>Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.</h4>
        <p>I have read and acknowledge the warnings above.</p>
