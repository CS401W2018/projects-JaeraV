        <h3>Engagement Questions:</h3>
        <h4>How much time should you spend on an engagement assignment after class?</h4>
        <p>
           Around 20-30 minutes, but if it helps me to understand the lessons better when practicing the things we discussed in class, then I can spend more time doing it.
        </p>

        <h4>What should you focus on during class and after class?</h4>
        <p>
            During class, I should focus on the discussion, especially trying to follow and understand what the code does and how it works. After class, I can practice the things we discussed through the lecture notes.

        <h4>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h4>
        <p>
            One of the main things is that grid is primarily for two dimensional while flex is for one dimensional. But flex is good for two dimensional as well. Another thing is that in grid, the parent determines the sizes of the space that the children occupies, on the other hand, in flex, the children gets to determine his own size or space and the parent will adjust after.
