        <h3>Engagement Questions</h3>
        <h4>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h4>
        <p>
            Block tags start a new line and occupies the full width of the screen, while inline tags does not start a new line and only takes as much width as the content inside them needs. Examples of block tags are header, nav, main, footer, div, p, h1, and many more. On the other hand, examples of inline tags are span, a, img, strong, em and others.
        </p>
            
        <h4>What is normal flow in HTML?</h4>
        <p>
            Normal flow is the default way that the elements are laid out or how they normally bahave on a webpage before any styling is applied. Normally, each block tag occupies the entire width of the screen.
        </p>

        <h4>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h4>
        <p>
            Float is a property in CSS that makes the elements float and have other content wrap around them. Instead of the block tag occupying the entire width, it shares space with the other tags below it. We need to clear the float so that no other content will wrap around the floating element.
        </p>

        <h4>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h4>
        <p>
            Absolute makes the position of an element be removed from the normal document flow. In fixed, the position of the element will also be removed in the document flow, however, it will always be relative to the viewport, in which even if you start scrolling, the element will stay in the same position. They usually use it on the header, so that it will stay fixed even if you start scrolling. Lastly, relative positions the element relative to its original position. It will still take space as if it is still part of the normal flow, and you can slide or change the position using top, right, bottom, and left.
        </p>
        
        <h4>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h4>
        <p>
            Turn the anchor link tag into a block using CSS, then add some padding. So that it will look like buttons you can click on.
        </p>

        <h4>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h4>
        <p>
            We can find videos to review in the "home" of the course and the lecture notes for the week.
