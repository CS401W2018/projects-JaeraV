        <h4>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h4>
        <p><em>Inline CSS</em></p>
        <p>It is done using style attribute in HTML elements and it overrides any other methods.</p>

        <p><em>Embedded CSS</em></p>
        <p>It is done by using a style tag somewhere inside the head section. It uses a selector which will identify which parts of your page will the style be applied to.</p>

        <p><em>External CSS</em></p>
        <p>This uses a separate ".css" file which will be linked to the HTML document you are working on, using a link tag in the head section.</p>

        <h4>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h4>
        <p>External CSS saves us a lot of time because if we want to make changes to the webpages in our website, we only need to change one css file. Also, it is for separation of concerns. Other people who are experts when it comes to designing websites can help you and they only need to see and update the css file and not your entire code for the HTML document.</p>

        <h4>What is a selector used for?</h4>
        <p>Selectors are used to select which parts or which elements in your HTML document will the style be applied to.</p>
