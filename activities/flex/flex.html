        <h4>What you learned about Flex and CSS.</h4>
        <p>
            There are so much I can do using Flex in CSS. I can move around the elements in my HTML content using "display: flex;" in CSS. I also learned how I can center my navigation using flex, which was my trouble figuring out before. Using flex also helps us to better view our webpage in both computer screen and mobile screen.

        <h4>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</h4>
        <p>
            I need to have an accessible website because it is a law or legal requirement especially if I will make an official website in the future. It needs to be accessible as to better cater people with special needs like colorblindess, hearing impairments, or blindness. To be an accessible website means that my website should allow everyone to navigate through it.
